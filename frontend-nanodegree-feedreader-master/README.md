This is my version of a JavaScript feedreader app tested using Jasmine for Project 6 of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

This project provided experience with writing a number of tests against a pre-existing JavaScript application using Jasmine.

Associated Udacity courses include:

JavaScript Testing
Goal of the Project:

To learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as event handling and DOM manipulation.
Create tests that are comprehensive enough to test the app functionality.
Bonus:

Additional tests that test additional features within the application.
Running the Tests:

To run the tests, clone it from my github account:

git clone https://github.com/rachelgura/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
and then open index.html in your browser.

The Jasmine spec results will show at the bottom of the window.

Results:

All required tests pass and are comprehensive enough to test the app.
Bonus tests and functionality added to allow sorting of feeds by clicking on the feed header title.
